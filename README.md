# PWM adafruit shield capatible library for building arduino-based quadruped robot
This library is based on popular library for building quadruped but was rewrited to use Adafruit_PWMServoDriver library as servo controller. As the result your robot will move and stay without tremor. Also to avoid any tremor please make separate power for arduino and PWM shield.
If you are using bluetooth terminal make sure that you have enabled to send \n (newline) after serial commands.
