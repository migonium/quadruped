# PWM arafruit shield capatible library for building quadruped robot
This library is based on popular library for building quadruped but was rewrited to use Adafruit_PWMServoDriver library as servo controller. As the result your robot will move and stay without tremor. Also to avoid any tremor please make separate power for arduino and PWM shield.
